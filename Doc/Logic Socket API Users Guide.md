# Logic Socket API Users Guide

The Saleae Logic software includes a basic TCP socket server, which can be used
to script basic software actions for automation.

This lets custom applications connect to the software's socket server, and then
send basic text commands to control different parts of the software, such as
device configuration, capture and export of raw or protocol data.

The socket connection is by default on port 10429, but can be modified in the
software's preferences dialog.

Please download the latest beta version of the software, as well as the
provided Saleae Socket API Github project.

To enable the scripting interface in the software, open the preferences dialog
from the options menu, select the developer tab, and then check the box for
"Enable scripting socket server". Save these changes.

The scripting interface is cross-platform, and will work on Windows, Linux, and
Mac.

The scripting interface supports a few commands. Some commands require
arguments. Arguments must be separated with the comma character: ','. **Note:
All commands sent over the socket API must be NULL terminated.** Note -- by
default, socket libraries will not append a null character to the transmitted
data, so one must be added manually, usually with the `\0` escape sequence.

Upon execution, each command will return back with either an "ACK" or a "NAK"
string. If any error occurs, or if the command is unrecognized, the software
will return "NAK". Some commands will return information, followed by the ACK
or NAK string.

We have also provided an automation tester program written in C# that will only
run on Windows. The program includes functions which will access and pass
commands to the software's socket for you.

## Saleae API Sample Project Layout

The Saleae Socket API Visual Studio solution contains two important projects.
Other projects may be present, but are not covered by this document.

`SaleaeSocketApi` is a class library that provides a basic C# API over the
socket functions described in this document. It produces a DLL which can be
used by other C# projects.

`SaleaeSocketApiExample` is a basic console application that uses the
`SaleaeSocketApi` class library. It demonstrates a handful of basic socket
commands.

## Demo Mode

The `SaleaeSocketApiExample` program will run through a sequence of
demonstration commands prompted by the enter key.

## Using the C# App

As a convenience, the `SaleaeClient` class, in the automation program, directly
implements C# functions for controlling the software.

An instance of the `SaleaeClient` class must be constructed in order to
establish the socket connection. The constructor takes both the IP address and
port number of the requested socket. The default values are set for localhost
and the default software socket port.

```C#
SaleaeClient(String host_str = "127.0.0.1", int port_input = 10429)
{
    this.port = port_input;
    this.host = host_str;
  
    Socket = new TcpClient(host, port);
    Stream = Socket.GetStream();
}
```

The functions may then be called from the created object:

```C#
Client = new SaleaeClient(host, port);
Client.FunctionCall();
```

## Software Capture

### Set Trigger

**Socket Command: set_trigger**

This command lets you configure the trigger. The command must be sent with the same number of parameters as there are active digital channels (analog channels are ignored). For example, if you currently have 6 active digital channels enabled, then the command will require 6 parameters to be present. Blank parameters are to be used for active channels that will not contain any trigger configurations. Also, if the trigger type is `negpulse` or `pospulse`, then the minimum and maximum pulse widths should be included immediately after the trigger type. Only a minimum pulse width is required though. If no maximum pulse width is specified, then any pulse longer than the specified minimum will be a valid trigger condition.

Parameter value options:

* `high`
* `low`
* `negedge`
* `posedge`
* `pospulse`
* `negpulse`

Examples:

8 Channels, with channel 2 set as a rising edge, with the additional requirement that channel 0 and channel 7 are high and channel 1 is low at the time of the rising edge. Channels 3-6 are not used by the trigger and left blank.

`set_trigger, high, low, posedge,,,,,high`

4 channels, with a positive pulse on channel 0, no other channels used by the trigger. The pulse must be between 1ms and 2ms in duration.

`set_trigger, pospulse, 0.001, 0.002,,,`

4 channels, same as above, but without a maximum pulse width. This sets the maximum pulse with to 'n/a' in the software. Note that there is not an additional placeholder for the maximum pulse width.

`set_trigger, pospulse, 0.001,,,,`

**C# Function**: `void SetTrigger(Trigger[] triggers, double minimum_pulse_width_s = 0.0, double maximum_pulse_width_s = 1.0)`

The function takes in an array of `enum Trigger`. The index of the array
corresponds to the channel. If a pulse trigger is used, then `minimum_pulse_width_s` and `maximum_pulse_width_s are used`. If `maximum_pulse_width_s` is set to 0.0, then no pulse width limit is used.

Note: the enum names in the provided C# library do not exactly match the names actually used by the socket API. The C# enum values (FallingEdge, RisingEdge, etc...) are mapped to the socket string names using C# attributes. The Trigger enum is defined in `SocketApiTypes.cs`.

Example:

```C#
Trigger[] trigger = {Trigger.High, Trigger.RisingEdge, Trigger.None, Trigger.Low, Trigger.High, Trigger.High, Trigger.None, Trigger.None };

SetTrigger(trigger);
```

### Set Number of Samples in Collection

**Socket Command: set_num_samples**

This command changes the number of samples to capture. (Note: USB transfer
chunks are about 33ms of data, so the number of samples you actually get are in
steps of 33ms)

If both analog and digital channels are enabled, this sets the number of digital samples to record, and not the least common multiple of analog and digital, as some other functions do.

Example:

`set_num_samples, 1000000`



**C# Function:** `void SetNumSamples(int num_samples)`

This function takes an integer to set the desired number of samples.



### Get Number of Samples in Collection

**Socket Command: get_num_samples**

This function returns the number of samples to capture.

If both digital and analog channels are enabled, this returns the number of samples at the LCM sample rate, which is the least common multiple of the digital and analog sample rates.

Example:

`get_num_samples`

Return Value:

`1000000\n`

**C# Function:** `int GetNumSamples()`

This function returns the number of samples to capture for.

Specifically, in mixed mode captures, it returns the number of samples at the LCM sample rate, which is the least common multiple of the digital and analog sample rates.


**Socket Command: set_capture_seconds**

This command changes the number of seconds to capture for.

Example:

`set_capture_seconds, 0.8`


**C# Function:** `void SetCaptureSeconds(double seconds)`

The function takes a double to set the desired number of seconds to capture
for.



### Set Collection Sample Rate

**Socket Command: set_sample_rate**

This command changes the sample rate in software. You must specify a sample
rate which is listed in the software. There is currently no helper function to
get a list of sample rates. (Note: to get the available sample rates, use
`get_all_sample_rates`).

Syntax: `set_sample_rate, $(digital_sample_rate), $(analog_sample_rate)`

Example:

Digital-only capture: `set_sample_rate, 1000000, 0`

Analog-only capture: `set_sample_rate, 0, 100000`

Both analog and digital capture: `set_sample_rate, 2000000, 1000000`



**C# Function:** `void SetSampleRate(SampleRate sample_rate)`

The function takes a struct that holds both the digital sample rate and the
analog sample rate.

### Get Selected Collection Sample Rate

**Socket Command: get_sample_rate**

This command returns the currently selected sample rate. It returns two numbers, the digital sample rate and the analog sample rate. These are delimited with a newline, and the response ends with a newline.

Syntax: `get_sample_rate`

Example: `get_sample_rate`

The current sample rate is 1 MS/s, digital only.

Response: `1000000\n0\n`



**C# Function:** `SampleRate GetSampleRate()`

The function returns a struct containing the current sample rates.

### Get Available Sample Rates

**Socket Command: get_all_sample_rates**

This command returns all the available sample rate combinations for the current
performance level and channel combination. Each newline is a separate sample rate pair. Analog and digital sample rates are separated by a comma.

Example: `get_all_sample_rates`

Response: `$(digital sample rate), $(analog_sample_rate)`

`5000000, 1250000`

`10000000, 625000`



**C# function:** `List<SampleRate> GetAvailableSampleRates()`

This function returns a list of all the sample rates available for the current
performance option and channel combination.

```C#
struct SampleRate
{
    public int AnalogSampleRate;
    public int DigitalSampleRate;
}
```



### Get Performance Option

**Socket Command: get_performance**

This command returns the currently-selected performance options.

Example: `get_performance`

Response: `100`



**C# Function:** `PerformanceOption GetPerformanceOption()`

This function returns the currently-selected performance option in the form of
an enum value.

```C#
enum PerformanceOption { OneHundredPercent = 100, EightyPercent = 80, SixtyPercent = 60, FortyPercent = 40, TwentyPercent = 20 };
```



### Set Performance Option

**Socket Command: set_performance**

This command sets the currently-selected performance option. Valid performance
options are: 20, 40, 60, 80, and 100. Note: This call will change the sample
rate currently selected.

Performance selection only applies to the new Logic 8, Logic Pro 8, and Logic Pro 16. Performance selection also only applies when digital and analog channels are enabled for the same capture. 

Performance does not apply to the original Logic, Logic16, or Logic 4. It also does not apply when the support devices are only capturing digital or only capturing analog channels.

The performance option is used as a second dimension of sample rate control When performing mixed captures.

When performing a digital-only capture or an analog-only capture, the available list of sample rates contain every possible sample rate for the given number of channels.

However, when a mixed mode capture is occurring, the sample rate list instead includes a list of sample rates that represent the trade-off between faster digital with slower analog and faster analog with slower digital rates. To lower the overall rate, performance is used.

Performance specifically limits the maximum throughput between the device and the PC, as a percentage.

For mixed mode captures, the list of available sample rates for a given device are a function of three factors. The total number of digital channels enabled, the number of analog channels enabled, and the performance option selected.

Syntax: `set_performance, $(value)`

Example: `set_performance, 80`



**C# Function:** `void SetPerformanceOption( PerformanceOption performance )`

This function sets the currently-selected performance option to the value of
`performance`.



### Get Capture Pre-Trigger Buffer Size

**Socket Command: get_capture_pretrigger_buffer_size**

This command gets the pretrigger buffer size of the capture.

Due to a bug in the Logic software, this returns an unusual value when both digital and analog channels are enabled.

Specifically, in mixed mode captures, it returns the number of samples at the LCM sample rate, which is the least common multiple of the digital and analog sample rates. 

Note that the set function does not have this issue.

Example:

`get_capture_pretrigger_buffer_size`



**C# Function:** `int GetCapturePretriggerBufferSize()`

The function returns an integer with the current pretrigger buffer size.



### Set Capture Pre-Trigger Buffer Size

**Socket Command: set_capture_pretrigger_buffer_size**

This command sets the pretrigger buffer size of the capture.

If both analog and digital channels are enabled, this sets the number of digital samples.

The software does not support setting this value to 0. Always use values greater than 0.

Example:

`set_capture_pretrigger_buffer_size, 1000000`



**C# Function:** `void SetCapturePretriggerBufferSize(int buffer_size)`

The function takes an integer with the desired buffer size.



## Device/Channel Selection

### Get Connected Devices

**Socket Command: get_connected_devices**

This command will return a list of the devices currently connected to the
computer. The connected device will have the return parameter ACTIVE at the end
of the line.

Example:

`get_connected_devices`

Response

```
1, Demo Logic, LOGIC_DEVICE, 0x19b2
2, My Logic 16, LOGIC16_DEVICE, 0x2b13, ACTIVE
ACK
```



**C# Function:** `ConnectedDevices[] GetConnectedDevices()`

The function returns an array of `ConnectedDevices` structs. The struct
contains the type of devices, the name, the device ID, the index of the device,
and whether or not the device is currently active.

```C#
struct ConnectedDevices
{
  String type;
  String name;
  int device_id;
  int index;
  bool is_active;
}
```

Usage Note:

Detecting if Logic hardware is connected to the PC can be determined by GetConnectedDevices(). If no Logic hardware is connected, 4 devices show up when you call GetConnectedDevices(). These are demo devices, and the response is similar to below.

```
1, Logic 8, LOGIC_8_DEVICE, 0x2dc9, ACTIVE
2, Logic Pro 8, LOGIC_PRO_8_DEVICE, 0x7243
3, Logic Pro 16, LOGIC_PRO_16_DEVICE, 0x673f
4, Logic 4, LOGIC_4_DEVICE, 0x6709
ACK
```

All demo devices will go away once a real device is connected. Simply wait a bit once the device is connected, send the GetConnectedDevices() command, and the real device will show up as device #1.

The device ID for the demo devices are 16-bit. The device ID for real devices are 64-bit. That is another way you can tell them apart.


### Select Active Device

**Socket Command: select_active_device**

This command will select the device set for active capture. It takes one
additional parameter: the index of the desired device as returned by the
`get_connected_devices` function. Note: Indices start at 1, not 0.

Example:

`select_active_device, 2`



**C# Function:** `void SelectActiveDevice(int device_number)`

The function takes in the index of the desired device as returned by the
`GetConnectedDevices()` function



### Changing Active Channels

**Socket Command: get_active_channels**

This command will return a list of the active channels.

Example:

`get_active_channels`

Response:

`digital_channels, 0, 4, 5, 7, analog_channels, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8`



**C# Function:** `void GetActiveChannels(List<int> digital_channels, List<int> analog_channels)`

This function populates the lists with the currently-active channels. The
integer in each list represents the channel number that is active.



### Set Active Channels

**Socket Command: set_active_channels**

This command allows you to set the active channels. Note: This feature is only
supported on Logic 16, Logic 8 (2nd gen), Logic Pro 8, and Logic Pro 16

Example:

`set_active_channels, digital_channels, 0, 4, 5, 7, analog_channels, 0, 1, 2, 5, 8`



**C# Function:** `void SetActiveChannels(int[] digital_channels = null, int[] analog_channels = null)`

This function takes an array of integers for both digital channels and analog
channels. Each integer represents the channel number to set active. Both
parameters support a null array. A null array represents disabling all the
channels for that type.

Example:

`SetActiveChannels(new int[] { 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 }, new int[] { 0, 1 });`



### Reset Active Channels

**Socket Command: reset_active_channels**

This command will set all channels active for the device.

Example:

`reset_active_channels`



**C# Function:** `void ResetActiveChannels()`

This function takes no parameters and returns none.



### Get Digital I/O Voltage Threshold

**Socket Command: get_digital_voltage_options**

This command returns a list of the available digital input I/O thresholds. This
is used on products with selectable input voltage thresholds. For instance,
Logic Pro 8 and Logic Pro 16 have different modes for the digital inputs, used
to record 1.2V digital logic, 1.8V digital logic, or 3.3V or higher digital
logic.

The response from this function is a list of options. Each option contains the
index, used to select it later, the string name, and then a flag -- either
"SELECTED" or "NOT_SELECTED" indicating which voltage setting is currently
active. Use the index with the set function to change the voltage option. We
recommend matching the voltage option based on the string name.

This feature is only supported on the original Logic 16, and the new Logic Pro
8 and Logic Pro 16.

Example:

`get_digital_voltage_options`

Response:

```
0, 1.2 Volts, SELECTED
1, 1.8 Volts, NOT_SELECTED
2, 3.3+ Volts, NOT_SELECTED
ACK
```



**C# Function:** `List<DigitalVoltageOption> GetDigitalVoltageOptions()`



### Set Digital I/O Voltage Threshold

**Socket Command: set_digital_voltage_option**

This command sets the active digital I/O voltage threshold for the device. The
only parameter is the index provided from the getter function.

This feature is only supported on the original Logic 16, and the new Logic Pro
8 and Logic Pro 16.

Example:

`set_digital_voltage_option, 0`



**C# Function:** `void SetDigitalVoltageOption(DigitalVoltageOption option)`



## Capture Data

### Capture

**Socket Command: capture**

This command starts a capture. It will return `NAK` if an error occurs.

The function will return `ACK` when the capture is complete.

Error cases:

- The capture fails to start due to a USB error.
  The software will return `NAK`
- The capture ends early due to a 'can\'t keep up' error.
  The software will return `ACK`, and the capture will be shorter than expected
- The capture ends early due to a 'can\'t keep up' error, however the trigger condition was never found.
  The software will return `NAK` because no data was captured.
- The `stop_capture` command is sent to the socket API before the capture completed
  THe software will return `ACK` and the capture will be shorter than expected
- The `stop_capture` command is sent to the socket API before the trigger event has been detected.
  THe software will return `NAK` since no data was recorded.

Example:

`capture`



**C# Function**: `void Capture()`

The function takes no parameters.

Note, the C# wrapper will block until the command ACKs or NAKs. This makes it unsuitable for use with `stop_capture` without modification.

Example:

`Capture()`



### Stop Capture

**Socket Command: stop_capture**

This command stops the current capture. This command will return `NAK` if no capture is in progress.

If a capture is in progress, it does not return a response. Instead, it initiates the end of the capture, and then the active capture command will send it's reply, either a `ACK` if any data is recorded, or a `NAK` if the capture was terminated before the trigger condition was found.

Use this function with care, as a race condition determines if one or two responses will be returned. This will be improved in future versions of the socket API and C# wrapper.

Specifically, if the `stop_capture` command is issued near simultaneously with the normal end of the capture, it is possible to get a single `ACK` response or two responses, `ACK` followed by `NAK`. The first is the case where the stop command ends the capture early, and the second case is when the stop command is applied after the capture has already completed, returning `NAK`.

Example:

`stop_capture`


**C# Function:** `void StopCapture()`

The function takes no parameters.

**Note:** The C# capture command blocks until the capture is complete.

As it is currently implemented, this function is not usable with the current `capture` command. In the future, we will add a non-blocking capture command to the C# wrapper.

Example:

`StopCapture()`



### Capture to File

**Socket Command: capture_to_file**

This command starts a capture, and then auto-saves the results to the specified
file. If an error occurs, the command will return `NAK`.

Note: You must have permissions to the destination path, or the save operation
will fail. By default, applications won't be able to save to the root of the C
drive on Windows. To do this, the Logic software must be launched with
administrator privileges.

The path passed in must be absolute and the destination directory must exist,
or the software will `NAK`. Relative paths and paths with special features like `~/` are not accepted.

Example:

`capture_to_file, c:\temp.logicdata`



**C# Function:** `void CaptureToFile(String file)`

The function takes a string with the file name to save to.

Example:

`CaptureToFile("C:\\temp_file");`



### Is Processing Complete

**Socket Command: is_processing_complete**

With the introduction of analog channels, processing data is no longer instant
and may take some time after the capture. You cannot export or save data until
processing is complete (The commands will `NAK`). This command returns a
boolean expressing whether or not the software is done processing data.

Note - we recommend waiting for just a moment after the capture completes before calling this function. The socket API largely emulates UI interactions, and the UI session may not have finished switching the moment the capture completed. This will be fixed in future revisions of the app. We recommend 1 second in the worst case to be sure the session has finished transitioning.

This function returns `TRUE` or `FALSE`, followed by a newline, and then a `ACK`. If no capture is opened, it will return a `NAK`.


**C# Function:** `bool IsProcessingComplete()`



## Save/Load

### Save to File

**Socket Command: save_to_file**

This command saves the results of the current tab to a specified file. (Write
permissions required, see `capture_to_file`).

Note: Data processing must be complete before this command is ran or it may
`NAK`. Use `is_processing_complete` to check if processing is done before
exporting data.

The path passed in must be absolute and the destination directory must exist,
or the software will `NAK`. Special path symbols like `~/` are not interpreted properly and should not be used.

Example:

`save_to_file, C:\temp.logicdata`



**C# Function:** `void SaveToFile(String file)`

The function takes a string with the file name to save to.

Example:

```C#
SaveToFile("C:\\temp_file");
```



### Load From File

**Socket Command: load_from_file**

This command loads the results of a previous capture from a specific file.

The path passed in must be absolute and the destination directory must exist,
or the software will `NAK`. Special path symbols like `~/` are not interpreted properly and should not be used.

This command can also be used to load a saved setup and apply to the currently open tab.

Note: The Logic software uses the file extension of the loaded file in order to determine what type of file is being loaded. The file must be a valid logic settings or logic data file, ending with either the `*.logicdata` or `*.logicsettings` file extension.

Example:

`load_from_file, C:\temp.logicdata`



**C# Function:** `void LoadFromFile(String file)`

This function takes a string with the file name to load from.

Example:

`LoadFromFile("C:\\temp_file")`



### Close All Tabs

**Socket Command: close_all_tabs**

This command closes all currently-open tabs. This command does not delete the
data in the capture tab. The command ACKs when complete.

Example:

`close_all_tabs`



**C# Function:** `void CloseAllTabs()`

The function writes the `close_all_tabs` command to the socket API.



## Analysis and Export

### Export Data 2

**Socket Command: export_data2**

It is highly recommended to examine the examples of this in the
`SaleaeSocketApiUnitTests` project. The raw data export process can be
extremely complex due to the large number of parameters and possible export
configurations.

The Saleae software supports four export file formats: CSV, Binary file,
Matlab, and VCD (Value Change Dump).

Each export option has its own specific parameters.

The CSV and Matlab formats are the only formats capable of exporting a mix of
analog and digital channels.

The Binary format supports exporting analog or digital, but not both at the
same time.

The VCD format is only capable of exporting digital data.

The export formats that support analog and digital data have some parameters
that only apply to one data type or the other. For instance, displaying analog
values as ADC values (0-4095 for most devices) or as calibrated voltages only
apply when exporting analog data.

To complicate things more, the CSV export mode has three sets of export
options: options when exporting only digital data, options when exporting only
analog data, and options when exporting both.

Finally, just to add icing to the cake, the types of channels that are active
in the original capture, regardless of which ones you would like to export,
also have an effect.

For example, if you record a few digital channels, and then export them as CSV,
you will need to use a slightly different command than if you recorded a few
digital channels and a few analog channels, but still only want to export the
digital channels to CSV.

All of this combined makes for a particularly complex command structure.

The export options are much easier to understand when using the GUI built into
the software. The socket command merely mimics this dialog. The export options
that are possible through the API are exactly the same as the export options on
the software, and they are mapped one-to-one. In fact, the parameters for the
export data command are actually the direct members of the backing store for
the software's GUI.

There is good news. If any parameter is included out-of-order, or missing, or
an extra parameter is added, the software's console output will tell you
exactly which parameter was not understood, and it will tell you exactly which
options were acceptable at that point.

For details on when each parameter is required, see comments in
[SocketApiTypes.cs](https://github.com/saleae/SaleaeSocketApi/blob/master/SaleaeSocketApi/SocketApiTypes.cs)
for the structure `ExportDataStruct`.

For examples of each use case, see the examples in
[ExportUnitTests.cs](https://github.com/saleae/SaleaeSocketApi/blob/master/SaleaeSocketApiUnitTests/ExportUnitTests.cs)
in the class `ExportUnitTests`.

The save path passed in must be absolute and the destination directory must
exist, or the software will `NAK`.



### Export Data [deprecated]

~~**Socket Command: export_data**~~

This function is still present in the Saleae software, but has never properly
supported Mixed mode exports (when analog and digital channels are present in
the export) and might not support digital-only or analog-only exports properly
when the original capture included digital and analog channels.

If you are already using this function successfully, it should be safe to keep
using. For new applications, please use Export Data 2. Export Data 2 is nearly
identical for standard exports (digital-only or analog-only) but explicitly
supports all possible configurations of export in mixed captures.

This function exports the data from the current capture to a file. There are
several options which are needed to specify how the data will be exported. The
options are order-specific. The software will send a `NAK` if the options are
out of order. Data processing much be complete before this command is ran or it
may `NAK`. See `is_processing_complete` to check if processing is done before
exporting data.

File Name: Specify the file to export to

Example: 

`export_data, C:\temp_file`

Channels: Specify the channels to export

* all_channels - export all active capture channels

* digital_channels/analog_channels - export only the specified channels.

  Example: `digital_channels, 0, 2, 3, analog_channels, 1, 2`

  If you are only exporting digital channels you may leave off
  `analog_channels` and vice versa. However, if both are included, digital must
  be first.

Analog Format: Specify how to output analog values. This setting has to be
included if you are exporting analog data. If you are exporting only digital
data, do not include this setting.

* Voltage – Outputs the voltage value.

* ADC – Outputs the ADC value.

  Example: `..., voltage, ...`

Time: Specify the range of time to export

* all_time: export the entire time range of the capture

* time_span: export time range between two values

  Example: `..., time_span, 0, 0.5, ...`

* timing_markers: export the time range between the two markers

You will need to specify the data format that the exported data will be
represented in. The required options vary depending on the format:

**CSV: include command csv**

* headers/no_headers: include column headers

* tab/comma: tab or comma delimiter

* sample_number/time_stamp: display current time of sample number for samples

* combined/separate: output a number, or a column for every bit

  If Separate: Add row_per_change/row_per_sample afterwards: output a row for
  every transition, or a row for every sample.

* Dec/Hex/Bin/Ascii: display in desired format

Example: `..., csv , headers, tab, sample_number, separate, row_per_change, hex`

**Binary: include command bin**

* each_sample/on_change:  output data for each sample or output data on transition
* 8/16/32/64: number of bits in output sample

Example: `..., binary, each_sample, 32`

**VCD: include command vcd**

No additional parameters required	

**Matlab: include command matlab**

No additional parameters required	

Examples:
`export_data, C:\temp_file, digital_channels, 0, 1, analog_channels, 1, voltage, all_time, adc, csv, headers, comma, time_stamp, separate, row_per_change, Dec`
`export_data, C:\temp_file, all_channels, time_span, 0.2, 0.4, vcd`
`export_data, C:\temp_file, analog_channels, 0, 1, 2, adc, all_time, matlab`



**C# Function:** `void ExportData(ExportDataStruct export_data_struct)`
The function takes a ExportDataStruct struct as its argument. The struct holds
all the information that is needed to export the data. For each option, there
is an enumeration to select which option you would like to choose.

```C#
public struct ExportDataStruct
{
   //File Name
   String FileName;

   //Channels
   public bool ExportAllChannels;
   public int[] DigitalChannelsToExport;

### Get Analyzers

**Socket Command: get_analyzers**

This function will return a list of analyzers currently attached to the
capture, along with indexes so you can access them later.

Note, the indices may not be sequential, and are unlikely to be so. It's also unlikely that they will start at zero, even if only one analyzer is present. Indices can change between captures. Be sure to always check analyzer indices when calling other analyzer specific APIs. 

Example:

`get_analyzers`

Response:

```
SPI, 0
I2C, 1
SPI, 2
```

Each line is separated by the `\n` character.



**C# Function:** `Analyzer[] GetAnalyzers()`

The function returns an array of Strings, each containing the name and index of
the analyzer.

```C#
struct Analyzer
{
  String type;
  int index;
}
```

Example:

`Analyzer[] Analyzers = GetAnalyzers()`



### Export Analyzers

**Socket Command:** `export_analyzer`

This command is used to export the analyzer results to a specified file. Pass
in the index from the `get_analyzers` function, along with the path to save to.

The path passed in must be absolute and the destination directory must exist,
or the software will `NAK`. Special path symbols like `~/` are not interpreted properly and should not be used.

Add a third, optional parameter to have the results piped back through the TCP
socket to you.

Note, an analyzer must finish processing before it can export its complete results. Use is_analyzer_complete to check if the analyzer has finished processing yet.

Example:

`export_analyzer, 0, C:\spi_results.csv`

`export_analyzer, 0, c:\spi_temp.csv, extra_parameter`

Results:

```
Time [s],Packet ID,MOSI,MISO
5.20833333333333e-006,0,'0','1'
9.375e-006,0,'1','2'
1.35416666666667e-005,0,'2','3'
2.6875e-005,1,'4','5'
3.10416666666667e-005,1,'5','6'
ACK
```

Please note that streaming the results back may add a little delay. This will
be fixed in future versions.



**C# Function:** `void ExportAnalyzers(int selected, String filename, bool mXmitFile)`

The function takes 3 parameters. The first is the index of the analyzer
returned from the `GetAnalyzers()` function. The second is the filename to save
to, and the third determines whether or not to pipe the information back
through the TCP socket to you. 

Note, this function was not setup to anything useful with streamed results. It currently just prints them to the console.



### Is Analyzer Complete

**Socket Command: is_analyzer_complete**

This command is used to get whether or not a specific analyzer has finished
processing the data and generating results. This command should be used before
trying to export an analyzer to verify it is done processing. To get analyzer
indexes, use `get_analyzers`.

Syntax: `is_analyzer_complete, $(analyzer_index)`

Example:

`is_analyzer_complete, 1`



**C# Function:** `bool IsAnalyzerProcessingComplete(int analyzer_index)`

This function takes the analyzer index and returns true if it is done
processing data and safe to export.


### Get Capture Range

*This function requires Logic 1.2.18 or newer*

This command will return information on how many samples were collected in the open capture.
Only issue this command if a capture is open.
It returns 4 values:

- Starting Sample. This is the index of the first accessible sample in the recording. It's usually zero, except when a trigger is used and the pre-trigger buffer was completely full, causing data older than the pre-trigger buffer size to be deleted.
- Trigger Sample. Usually zero, except for when a trigger was used.
- Ending sample. The last sample index in the capture.
- LCM Sample Rate. Use this sample rate to convert between time and sample index. this is the least common multiple of the digital and analog sample rates used for the capture.

Syntax: `get_capture_range`

Response:

```
<starting sample>, <trigger sample>, <ending sample>, <lcm sample>
```

*Note that the 3 sample indexes are unsigned 64 bit integers, and will frequently exceed the size of a 32 bit integer. Take care to perform all operations on these numbers using 64 bit integers.*

The LCM sample rate is a 32 bit integer.

**C# Function:** `CaptureRange GetCaptureRange()`

This function returns a struct containing the parsed return values.

### Get View State

*This function requires Logic 1.2.18 or newer*

This command returns the current zoom and pan offset of the display.
Only issue this command if a capture is open.

It returns 3 values:

- Zoom Samples Per Pixel. This is the zoom level of the display, in units how many samples are represented by a single horizontal pixel. Large numbers indicate that the view is zoomed out, displaying a large part of the capture in a small number of pixels. Small values indicate that the display is zoomed in.
- Pan Starting Sample. This is the sample index of the first sample on the left edge of the graph.
- LCM Sample Rate. Use this sample rate to convert between time and sample index. this is the least common multiple of the digital and analog sample rates used for the capture.

Syntax: `get_viewstate`

Response:

```
<zoom samples per pixel>, <pan starting sample>, <LCM sample rate>
```

**C# Function:** `ViewState GetViewState()`

This function returns a struct containing the parsed return values.

### Set View State

*This function requires Logic 1.2.18 or newer*

This command sets the current zoom and pan offset of the display.
Only issue this command if a capture is open.

There are two parameters:

- zoom samples per pixel. This is the zoom level, as described in 'Get View State', as a double precision floating point number.
- pan starting sample. This is the index of the first sample on the left edge of the display, as described above. It is a double precision floating point number.

The zoom level does not have fixed limits. You can zoom in until there are only 5 real samples on the display. Settings values more zoomed in than this will snap to this zoom level. You can zoom out until the entire dataset is on the display at once. Zooming out further will snap to this level.
The Pan is limited to keeping data covering the entire graph - you cannot pan the data so far that the graph becomes blank on either side.
Use the LCM sample rate returned from the above function in order to convert between time and sample indexes.

Syntax: `get_viewstate, 100.0, 10000.0`

**C# Function:** `void SetViewState( double zoom_samples_per_pixel, double pan_starting_sample )`

### Exit

**Socket Command: exit**

This command closes the software. It returns `ACK` before the software exits.

Syntax: `exit`

**C# Function:** `void Exit()`

Do not call any other commands after closing the software. The `SaleaeClient` class was not designed to be reconnectable, so the best way to establish a new connection would be to construct a new one.
